# Time Series Analysis and Forecast Predictions for COVID-19 Vaccine Administrations

This project aims to investigate the similarities and differences in COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs across 32 countries in the European Union and North America through 
  - time-series decomposition
  - time series distance metrics
 
Additionally, this project analyzes:
  - pairwise dynamic time warping costs within the EU and within North America
  - modeling vaccination forecasts using the FBProphet open source model for the United States and Canada
